Learning More from Retrospectives
---------------------------

How do you perform retrospectives? Have you had retrospectives where these three questions are always asked in round robin style?
- What has been positive? 
- What has been negative? 
- Is there anything we want improve? 

Here are some tips that I have found to be effective when it comes to learning more from retrospectives, and even having some fun at the same time.

###(!!TRENGER ET BRA NAVN PÃ… "Follow a Pattern")
When you perform a retrospective there is usually a pattern you can follow. 
Have an _Introduction_, this is when you can warm up and come into the retrospective mentality. This is usually done with a short 5 minute or less activity.

Then you can go into the _information gathering_ phase. Here you want to collect all problems, obstacles, give creds, and positive feedbacks. This is usually done by having the team members writing post-its that can be presented when the are finished.

The last phase is the _grouping and discussion_ phase. This is when you want to group the information gatheres from the previous phase, and find the most important points you want to follow up and resolve. When you discuss the points you want to end up with something that actively can be done to keep the positive habits or to fix the problems and obstacles. To make sure that follow up is done, you can assign it to someone and put a due date on it.
